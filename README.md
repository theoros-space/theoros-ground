## Overview

Where operators work with Theoros. Register satellites and sensor profiles,
choose models, schedule deployments and see what each satellite found, with
the downlink it saved.

## Repository layout

Planned structure. Directories appear as the code lands.

```text
api/          OpenAPI specification
backend/      services
frontend/     dashboard
docs/         requirements and data model
```

## Requirements

Every requirement lives in [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) with
the prefix `GND-REQ`. Each one names how it is verified (test, analysis or
inspection), and every pull request that changes behaviour cites the
requirement it serves.
